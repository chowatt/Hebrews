# Introduction

Our author has spent Chapters 5-7 showing us that the Son, Jesus, has been appointed a high priest. He was made a high priest not accordning to the Mosaic law, but accordning to an oath that God made thus affirming that he is a greater high priest than the Levitical high priests of Israel. Now, in Chapter 8, our author turns his attention to the task of a High priest: to make offerings. In this case, Christ offers a better offering.

As he transitions to the work of this better high priest, he also includes the place where the high priest ministers. One of the limitations of the Levitical priest hood was that they served in temple that is a shadow of the true one. Now that a high priest who has ascended into heaven where the true temple exists, this high priest now offers a superior or better offering.

This superiority is shown in three areans: First, the offering is made in a better temple, second, it is offered in the context of a better covenant, and third, it is a better and superior offering in and of itself.

# I. Jesus ministry is a heavenly ministry better than the earthly one.
**Hebrews 8:1-6**

The asertion that the son as a priest has entered into a heavenly temple has already been made in both 4:14 and 6:19-20. Just prior to chapter 8 (8:26-28) the author has argued that the kind of high priest we need is described in 7:1-25. This is not just a theoretical high priest out there somewhere: he is actually a priest who lived among his people, was crucified, risen, and now sits at the right hand of the father in a place of power.

This ministry of Jesus is better than the Levitical priest hood not just because of the nature of the priesthood (chapter 7), but also because of the service the priesthood provides. This is seen in better place that this new high priest serves.

In order to understand where the author is going with this line of argument, we must understand that the idea of covenant introduced in 7:22. This covenant is the central piece to everythign that Jesus has done as high priest. There already is a covenant in place, there are problems with the execution of it that must be addressed. Those concerns were addressed by the prophet Isaiah and quoted here in the last half of the chapter.

For now, we must focus our attention on the Temple that Jesus serves in.

## A. The Temple of the New Covenant is Better than the Earthly One

The contrast between the earthly temple and the true temple is the focus of Jesus ministry and the location where his service takes place. The author makes a series of contrasts between the Levitical priesthood and the ministry of the Son.

### 1. The Builder this Other Temple is God

The temple will be discussed in more detail in chapter 9, but what we need to know right now is that the temple on earth was built with human hands at the command and plan of God. This is a temple in heaven which contrasts with the temple on earth. An earthly temple is by its nature temporary. In fact, the author actually refers to the tent or tabernacle, though the can be included in this imagry as well. The tent was not permanent: it could be moved. But, the temple in heaven is permannt and that is why it is better than the earthly tabernacle.

### 2. The Sacrifices Made in this Temple are Better

The author first argues that if there is a high priest, there is necesarily a need for that priest to offer sacrifices. The Son is no exception and also have a sacrifice to offer. The nature of this sacrifice is also discussed in chapter 9:11-28.

The question in the mind of the author at this point is that the, juast as with Christ's geneology disqualified him on the basis of Mosaic law, so to does Mosaic law disqualify him from making an offering in the earthly temple. This is further justification for having a new covenant which is introduced in verse 6.

The nature of the tabernacle also points to the eventual fulfillement of the Son in his work. The tabernacle and the priests who served in it was orchestrated by God who dedicated an extended and lenghty amount of Holy Scripture describing how the tabernacle was to be built and how the priests were to serve in that tabernacle.

The nature of the earthly priest hood was that they served a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. This is to say that the earthly things were pointing to something much more signifigant than what you could see on the surface. From the temple to the covenent: the things Isreal were given were a foreshadowing of something even bigger.

This is the reason that God through Moses instructed the Israelites in such specific detail: to mess up the shadow would in effect misrepresent the actual thing to which it points.

## B. The Covenant Which is Introduced by the Son is Better

The curx of the issue is that the new Covenant is instituted on better promises than the old one. There was a particular problem with the old covenant. In other places in the NT, the New Covenant focuses on the different nature of the new covenant, but in the current passage the author focuses on the inadaquacy of the Old Covenant. The problem was not with the content of that covenant, but with the people. The fact that there must be a new covenant is evidence that something went terribly wrong with the old one. There are probably severl things the author has in mind. Perhaps it was the inability of the Old Covenant to bring about the kind of relationship God wanted with humanity (Guthrie, 595.)

The question in verse 8:7 is what the problem with the first covenant was: The problem was that the people of Israel did not keep the covenant. This is evidenced by what Jeremiah descrived in chapter 33 of his book. Verse 9 makes the problem apparent: "They did not continue in my covenant."

### 1. God promises a new covenant
**Hebrews 8:8**

### 2. The nature of the new covenant is different than the first one
** Hebrews 8:10-12**

First, unlike the old law whcih was written on stone and had blessings and cursings, the new covenant will be written on the heart. People were born into the old covenant and they may or may not take an interest in their heart concerning the rules and regulations. Sure there was external pressure from their family and friends, but there was nothing that made it on the inside apart from God's grace. Under the new covenant, everyone who is a member will indeed know God's law and will by, at their core, obedient to it.

Second, Every member will know God and relate to him as God and them his people.

Third, God will forgive their sins and not hold their failures against them. Under the Old Covenent, every disobedience received a retribution (Chapter 2.) However, under the new order, Christ has already taken the retrubution on our behalf. This does not mean we can take our disobedience lightly, because it costs dearly. It does mean, that God is not only long suffering with us, but he also causes us to will what he desires and empowers us to obey his will.

Finally, This section is the largest quote of the Old Testament in the New Testament. You would think that the author would give a lot of commentary on this passage, but he only gives one line: when a new covenant makes an appearance, it signifies the death and passing away of the old one. Praise God that a new one has been established in Christ.
