# Chapter 6

After challenging the believers in the last part of chapter 5, the author of Hebrews does the unexpected and not acquiesce to their needs. Instead of giving them milk, the directs them to the solid food. In moving forward, he is leaving something behind, namely the elementary principals. This is not to say that the rudimentary and fundamental truths of the faith are unnecessary, rather we need to go beyond them. Just as the letters of the alphabet are essential to the proper reading of texts, so are the elementary principles of the Christian faith necessary to the understanding of the full weight of Christianity. The reason he must move on is because he is trying to motivate the listeners to abandon their indifference to the more significant matters of following Christ.

## Foundational Principles

Though not the author’s particular focus, he does point out six specific areas that the believers should know about before they can talk about other things going forward. There there may be a Jewish background in these items, the are also closely related to the Christian faith. This was the understanding of the early church fathers, but modern commentators see things a little different.

## Moving on to Maturity

In verse 3, the author indicates that the result of what he wants to accomplish and if God desires it, the readers will move on from immaturity to maturity.

## A Difficult Warning

Guthrie breaks down the passage in the following way:

In essence, those who have become partakers of the heavenly gift and enlightened in the elementary principles of the faith are like those who were in the wilderness, saw God’s works, but did not believe. 

The passage is purposely ambiguous and the author does not define his terms. It is important to remember that the purpose of this passage, as harsh as it may seem, is to encourage the reader. There may be those who may seem to have genuine faith, but they have rejected Christ and returned to the Jewish sacrificial system.

### The identity of those in danger

The most difficult part of the interpretation of this passage is the identity of those who are in danger of apostasy. The particular people in mind are those who have shared in the privileges of the community of faith. They have had such interaction in four specific ways, that makes their turning away a great danger. Just as the spies of Canaan saw the fruit of the land and returned with the tokens of the good land, yet 

“Having been Enlightened.” Possible a reference to Baptism or more likely to those who had early instructions in Christian doctrine. Later 10:32 has the only other use of receiving light as a reference to their initial understanding of the Gospel.

“Tasted the heavenly gift.” Possible reference to communion. 

“Shared in the Holy Spirit.” 

“Tasted the goodness of the word of God”

In short, these are people who have had close contact with believer and have actually been involved in the practices of Christians. Perhaps they were baptized and took of the Lord’s supper. But in all their associations with Christians, they have not truly believed.

The best illustration of this kind of apostasy is probably Simon Magus or Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 8:9-24. Luke records that Simon was among the people who heard Philip preach. He believed as was baptized (#1), he continued with Philip, he saw signs and miracles (#3) saw the giving of the Spirit through the apostles. This man had all the signs of being in the community of faith, but his heart was not right before God (8:21) revealed by his desire for power apart from relationship with Christ.

I believe this is the case because we have already seen another group of people who were a part of the community of faith, Israel, and experienced God’s word, yet they did not mix what they had heard with faith.

## Why Restoration is Impossible

Not only have these people been involved in Christianity, they then fall away. The idea is to turn back away from Christ. If these believers came from Judaism, it is conceivable that they could still maintain some ideas from Christianity but go back to their former life and worship. Gentiles, however, if they were to go back to their life of paganism would have a clean break from Christianity.

The final phrase of verse 6 indicates either time or cause. If this is speaking to time, the understanding would be that these believers cannot be restored while they are Crucifying again the son of God, and as soon as they stop, they can be restored. However, it is probably better to see the phrase as dealing with cause. They reason they cannot be restored is because they are rejecting the very thing that can restore them.

The agricultural illustration helps us to see that the author's point is readily seen in the world around us. One cannot be exposed to everything good and healthy for spiritual vitality and then produce no fruit. Rather, in spite of all that God has done, unfruitful results occur so that they are under God’s wrath.

Thus, I see these people as those who are unbelievers who having great privileges in being around the community of faith but not being regenerated or believing are actually not in fellowship with Christ. There are difficulties with this view since how the author describes these people are those who have relationship with Christ. I believe that this is also a warning and a question to us to ensure that we are not deceiving ourselves about our own relationship with Christ.

The author already established that those who hold onto their original confident, or maintain their faith in Christ really did believe in the past (Heb. 3:14). The case here those is that those who fall away did not share in Christ in the first place.

## A Settled Encouragement

In spite of the harsh message the author has for the Hebrews, he continues to encourage them. Those the warning is a valid warning and not a theoretical possibility, the author is convinced that none of the readers actually fall into this category. They may be immature in Christ, but their actions reveal that Christ does reign in their midsts.

### Actions reveal the heart of faith

The primary evidence that these people are not apostates is that there was evident fruit of faith that was present in their lives. Perhaps it is the description of their work in 10:32-34.

The desire of the author is that these believers instead of turning away from Christ would actually maintain their faith.

Be imitators. Sets up his further discussion in chapter 11.

## God’s Promise as Foundation for our Hope

As the author encourages the readers to maintain their faith by imitating those who inherit God’s promises, we now turn to the father of the faithful, Abraham, and the promises that God made to him.

Abraham is rightly a man of faith, and believed. This is seen that he patiently waited for the promise to be fulfilled. However, 13-20 deals more specifically with the one who made the promise and answers the questions concerning: how can we know that the promises are trustworthy? The answer is found in the nature and character of God.

### The Particular Promise Made

The author argues from the specific to the generic in this case by showing that a specific promise made to Abraham had the most assured promise behind it. This promise is important because of another figure that Abraham interacted with and the promise and oath God makes about his son being of the order of Melchizedek.

The promise God made to Abraham was that his descendants would be numerous. This was made when Abraham was an old man and had no children already. Yet, Abraham saw the beginning of the fulfillment of this promise when his son Isaac was born.

### The Nature of a Promise or Oath

When human beings make an oath, they do so to emphasize the “certainty and solemnity of their words, they swear by someone or something greater than themselves.” Courts of law have traditionally used the Bible as a higher authority, standing in place of God, which indicates the oath taker is declaring that his words are true. 

In this case, God wanted to show the power of his oath, so he did so through swearing by himself. The particular characteristic that God wanted to reveal the unchangeable nature of his purpose, and that it is impossible for God to lie.

### Our faith is not in a weak foundation

Because of what Jesus did, we have a foundation of hope that cannot be moved. Jesus became a high priest, by the unchangeable oath of God and his is forever that priest after the order of Melchizedek.
