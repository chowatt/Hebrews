# Chapter 6

After challenging the believers in the last part of chapter 5, the author of Hebrews does the unexpected and not acquiesce to their needs. Instead of giving them milk, the directs them to the solid food. In moving forward, he is leaving something behind, namely the elementary principals. This is not to say that the rudimentary and fundamental truths of the faith are unnecessary, rather we need to go beyond them. Just as the letters of the alphabet are essential to the proper reading of texts, so are the elementary principles of the Christian faith necessary to the understanding of the full weight of Christianity. The reason he must move on is because he is trying to motivate the listeners to abandon their indifference to the more significant matters of following Christ.

## Foundational Principles

Though not the author’s particular focus, he does point out six specific areas that the believers should know about before they can talk about other things going forward. There there may be a Jewish background in these items, the are also closely related to the Christian faith. This was the understanding of the early church fathers, but modern commentators see things a little different.

## Moving on to Maturity

In verse 3, the author indicates that the result of what he wants to accomplish and if God desires it, the readers will move on from immaturity to maturity.

## A Difficult Warning

Guthrie breaks down the passage in the following way:

In essence, those who have become partakers of the heavenly gift and enlightened in the elementary principles of the faith are like those who were in the wilderness, saw God’s works, but did not believe. 

The passage is purposely ambiguous and the author does not define his terms. It is important to remember that the purpose of this passage, as harsh as it may seem, is to encourage the reader. There may be those who may seem to have genuine faith, but they have rejected Christ and returned to the Jewish sacrificial system.

### The identity of those in danger

The most difficult part of the interpretation of this passage is the identity of those who are in danger of apostasy. The particular people in mind are those who have shared in the privileges of the community of faith. They have had such interaction in four specific ways, that makes their turning away a great danger. Just as the spies of Canaan saw the fruit of the land and returned with the tokens of the good land, yet 

1. “Having been Enlightened.” Possible a reference to Baptism or more likely to those who had early instructions in Christian doctrine. Later 10:32 has the only other use of receiving light as a reference to their initial understanding of the Gospel.

2. “Tasted the heavenly gift.” Possible reference to communion. 

3. “Shared in the Holy Spirit.” 

4. “Tasted the goodness of the word of God”

In short, these are people who have had close contact with believers and have actually been involved in the practices of Christians. Perhaps they were baptized and took of the Lord’s supper. But in all their associations with Christians, they have not truly believed.

The best illustration of this kind of apostasy is probably Simon Magus or Simon the Sorcerer in Acts 8:9-24. Luke records that Simon was among the people who heard Philip preach. He believed as was baptized (#1), he continued with Philip, he saw signs and miracles (#3) saw the giving of the Spirit through the apostles. This man had all the signs of being in the community of faith, but his heart was not right before God (8:21) revealed by his desire for power apart from relationship with Christ.

I believe this is the case because we have already seen another group of people who were a part of the community of faith, Israel, and experienced God’s word, yet they did not mix what they had heard with faith.

## Why Restoration is Impossible

Not only have these people been involved in Christianity, they then fall away. The idea is to turn back away from Christ. If these believers came from Judaism, it is conceivable that they could still maintain some ideas from Christianity but go back to their former life and worship. Gentiles, however, if they were to go back to their life of paganism would have a clean break from Christianity.

The final phrase of verse 6 indicates either time or cause. If this is speaking to time, the understanding would be that these believers cannot be restored while they are Crucifying again the son of God, and as soon as they stop, they can be restored. However, it is probably better to see the phrase as dealing with cause. They reason they cannot be restored is because they are rejecting the very thing that can restore them.

The agricultural illustration helps us to see that the author's point is readily seen in the world around us. One cannot be exposed to everything good and healthy for spiritual vitality and then produce no fruit. Rather, in spite of all that God has done, unfruitful results occur so that they are under God’s wrath.

Thus, I see these people as those who are unbelievers who having great privileges in being around the community of faith but not being regenerated or believing are actually not in fellowship with Christ. There are difficulties with this view since how the author describes these people are those who have relationship with Christ. I believe that this is also a warning and a question to us to ensure that we are not deceiving ourselves about our own relationship with Christ.

The author already established that those who hold onto their original confident, or maintain their faith in Christ really did believe in the past (Heb. 3:14). The case here those is that those who fall away did not share in Christ in the first place.

## A Settled Encouragement

In spite of the harsh message the author has for the Hebrews, he continues to encourage them. Those the warning is a valid warning and not a theoretical possibility, the author is convinced that none of the readers actually fall into this category. They may be immature in Christ, but their actions reveal that Christ does reign in their midsts.

### Actions reveal the heart of faith

The primary evidence that these people are not apostates is that there was evident fruit of faith that was present in their lives. Perhaps it is the description of their work in 10:32-34.

The desire of the author is that these believers instead of turning away from Christ would actually maintain their faith.

Be imitators. Sets up his further discussion in chapter 11.

## God’s Promise as Foundation for our Hope

**Hebrews 6:13-20**

How does a promise work? We saw in 6:12 that the author wants his readers to be ones who believe or have faith and inherit the promises that God made. In fact, these readers are to not be sluggish, but work hard at their faith so they may inherit. So, in this case, there are three things needed: one, a promise, and two, a faith which believes that promise, and finally, one to fulfill the promise. The author encourages the readers to maintain their faith by imitating those who inherit God’s promises, we now turn to the father of the faithful, Abraham, and the promises that God made to him.

Abraham is not the subject of this particular passage. He is rightly a man of faith, and believed promises that he later saw the initial fruits of. This is seen that he patiently waited for the promise to be fulfilled. However, 13-20 deals more specifically with the one who made the promise and answers the questions concerning: how can we know that the promises are trustworthy? The answer is found in the nature and character of God.

There are a few things the author wants his readers to get in this section. First, The example of Abraham shows us the connection between these believers and Melchezedek. Second, oaths are final and are something that cannot be revoked. In a legal sense, they are an assurance that the speaker is saying the truth. Finally, there is a great hope because of the finality of oaths, especially those made by God.

### The Particular Promise Made

Let's take a look at the actual promise that God made with Abraham. The author argues from the specific to the generic in this case by showing that a specific promise made to Abraham had the ample evidence behind it that he would actually receive it. This promise is important because of another figure that Abraham interacted with and the promise and oath God makes about his son being of the order of Melchizedek.

The promise God made to Abraham was that his descendants would be numerous. Genesis 22:17 is the background that the author of Hebrews uses. This recounts when Abraham was an old man and had no children already. Yet, Abraham saw the beginning of the fulfillment of this promise when his son Isaac was born.

This promise God made is with an oath. It is the nature of an oath that the Author wants to direct our attention to.

### The Nature of a Promise or Oath

There are two charastics of oaths when used in human courts either ancient or modern. When human beings make an oath, they do so to emphasize the “certainty and solemnity of their words, they swear by someone or something greater than themselves.” The first charastic is that there is an appeal to a higher authority. Our U.S. courts of law have traditionally used the Bible as a higher authority, standing in place of God, which indicates the oath taker is declaring that his words are true. In doing so, the credibility of the witness is tied to the credibility of another. [1]

In this case, God wanted to show the power of his oath. How then does the greatest being, with no one higher than himself, swear by something greater. He does so through swearing by himself. The particular characteristic that God wanted to reveal the unchangeable nature of his purpose, and that it is impossible for God to lie.

The second charistic of an oath is that it is a confirmation (legal or otherwise) or guanatee that one's testamony is truthful. Human courts of law take such oaths and testamony as establishing truth and is used in our affairs. How much more so when God should also guaantee his promises with an oath.

In the case of this oath, God desired to confirm with Abraham the certainity of what he was going to do through Abraham's yet to be decendents.

### God's promises reveal his character

The promise to Abraham and God's faithfulness is not the ultimate destination that the author wants to take us to, though they are critical and foundational. These promises are not just facts of reality to be mentally absorbed; they are a reality that changes how we are to view the world around us and especially things that we cannot see. God's purpose for making this promise to Abraham is to show the "heris of the promise" his unchangeable character.

There are several things we have to deal with in determining the meaning of the passage. First, in 6:12, the author refercs to those who inerit the promises. What promise is in view? Is the promise in view the promise to Abrahams which comes after (6:13-20), the promise of the Son being a priest after the order of Melchezedek (5:5-6), or the promise of rest earlier in the letter (4:1). There are a lot of potential refernts. The author has in mind probably all of these promises and his point is that when God makes a promise, those who inherit it will receive it.

First, Abraham received his promise and those who came from him are proof of that promise being fulfilled.

The promise of rest is still available for those who hear God's word and believe it. The rest of discontinuing our works comes when we rest of Jesus' completed work.

Third, Jesus, being called a high priest after the order of Melchezedek will be a priest after such an order. This promise is crucial to our own salvation as the author will describe what Jesus does in fulfiling this priesthood in chapters 7-10.

Who does the author have in mind when he refers to the heirs of the promise? Certainly in this context it probably is not refering to only Christians of the Author's time. Rather is is more likely that he has in mind all Christians of all times. God's promises of the past are not just for them, we inherit them not by virtue of natural decendency, but on the presence of faith.

### Our faith is not in a weak foundation

The remainder of the chapter returns us to the readers, and by extention ourselves. What are the two unchangable things that we are to identify? The first is that God's promises are a sure foundation, He cannot lie. The second is that he swore by an oath his promises. Both of these actions are the strong foundation that we can "flee" to. 

The implication of fleeing is for refuge. Why did we flee? To take hold of the hope set before us. The language used in verse 18 about fleeing for refuge is see in the OT where sanctuary is given to those who accidenlty kill someone. This phrase also is the author's way of saying things that Paul often says about putting off and putting on. In this case, we are to flee in order to hold fast to Christ.

### An Ancor for the Soul

The immagry of an ancor would be familiar to anyone living around the Mediterranian world. An ancor's task is to moor a ship to a single spot. The hooks of the ancor grip the rocks on the sea floor connecting the ship with something unmovable. The Author is saying that the hope and trust that we have in God is like that ancor. That is why it is vital that the stability and veracity of God's promises were shown to be trustwothy.

The reason that this hope is steadfast and we can trust it is because the "hope" is that Christ enters the most holy sanctuary behind the curtain to serve as priest on our behalf after the order of Melchezedek. Because of what Jesus did, we have a foundation of hope that cannot be moved. Jesus became a high priest, by the unchangeable oath of God and his is forever that priest after the order of Melchizedek.

### Applications

How should we respond to this truth about God? 

First, we cannot afford to think shallowly about who God is, His character, and his acts. Our thinkigng about Him, grounded in Scripture, tell us about God and how we are to interact with him. It is therefore vital that we not get this wrong by trusting our own thoughts about him, but trust what God reveals about himself.First

Second, the more important thing about us is not what we do, but what we believe. If we genuinely believe something to be true, we will act accordingly. If we believe there is a fire in the building, we will attempt to escape. If God keeps his promises, we should be persuaded to belleve them, and in so doing, we act in accordance. The nation of Israel was faced with a choice to believe God when they were standiing at the edge of Caanan with the report of the spies, but they did not believe God's word and that in turn affected their actions: they did not go into the land. After the warning of the first part of chapter 6, we must not allow a false sense of security that we are ok with God to fester but only a hope that resides in Jesus.

Third, What other ideas or things may we trust in that may cause us to place our hope in and ancor our souls to that are not permanent or movable? Later, the Author is going to argue that God will case the world to shake and everythign that is not permant will be gone and only what is solid and unmovable will remain. We have just seen that there is a solid foundation that God is trustworthy and that the priest after the order of Melchezedek will be able to rescue and save those who ancor their souls to him. The question is, have we ancored to him?

Fnally, Do we consider God to be trustworthy?
