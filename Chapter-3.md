# Chapter 3

Hebrews chapter 1 and 2 introduce Jesus as the final revelation from God, who brings a message greater than the message angels brought with much more serious consequences for ignoring or disobeying the commands. Chapter two specifically focuses on the founder of our salvation and the necessity that the Son, who being the express image of the Father, needed to become like those whom he intended to save. This was necessary because humans, unlike angels, cannot die, so he had to be made like his brothers.

Chapter three tells the reader what to do in relationship to the truth that there is a great salvation and that salvation is found in Christ: Consider Jesus!

## Consider Jesus
Hebrews 3:1-6

Subject: Jesus bring better than Moses requires us to consider Jesus.
Context: The author of Hebrews is writing to a Jewish audience who have initially trusted Christ, but is in danger of turning back to their former religious practice and thus their backs on Jesus. The author constantly reminds the reader that what they are turning away from, Jesus, is greater than what they are turning back to. To abandon Christ is to desert their salvation and indicates that they did not have faith in God in the same way that their ancestors turned back and did not believe.

Proposition: Jesus is worthy of our devoted attention because he is better than Moses who came before him.

Purpose: I want my audience to  ensure that they themselves are considering Jesus as their Lord right now, not just as a passing event in the past.

Interrogative: What reasons do we have to consider Jesus?

What would you consider to be your greatest need today? We all come into this world with needs. People have tried to put these needs into various hierarchies where more basic needs must be fulfilled before higher needs can be fulfilled. For example, Abraham Maslow argued that the physical needs of food, shelter, and sleep need to be fulfilled before the higher order need such as morality can be satisfied. However, there are even more basic needs than food and shelter.

We need a word from God and a way to God. These are basic needs that often we human beings neglect. The fulfillment of these two needs is the subject of our passage today. This passage in Hebrews 3:1-6 tell us both about the needs we have as well as the solution to those deepest needs. The answer to both of these needs is summed up in a command that we will read shortly: Consider Jesus.

Transition: The author does not want us to simply obey this command without good reason. Why should we consider this man, Jesus, above any other man in the world? The author tells us why.

Proposition: Jesus is worthy of our devoted attention because he is better than Moses who came before him.

In this passage we will see four reasons why we must consider Jesus. There is a reason because of who we are, a reason because of who Jesus is, a reason because of what Jesus does, and a reason because of the dangers associated with failing to consider Jesus.

Transition: Our first reason why we must consider Jesus is because we have a heavenly calling.

## We must consider Jesus because we share in a heavenly calling

Transition: We must consider two facts about ourselves in order to understand who we are and our relationship to Jesus. We need these truths in order to give our full attention to considering Jesus. Both of these facts reveal our needs which we introduced in the introduction.
What are these two facts about ourselves that we must consider? The first is that we all share in a common family.

### We share in a common family

Explanation: In chapter two, we learn that Jesus is greater than the angels because the world was subjected to him. We also learn that Jesus is the one who brings salvation. Though he was God, he chose to suffer alongside us. This was “fitting”, as the author puts it, because in the grand plan of God in making a family, it would not work if every member of that family suffered except one. That is why it was fitting for Jesus to suffer. The end result of Christ’s work was bringing many sons to glory. This is why in our text, the author can describe us a both Holy and Brothers.

Argumentation: This word holy is certainly used of God, but perhaps you feel quite at odds internally with this assessment. For example, which of us looks at our lives and would say, “I have made it! I no longer know what it’s like to sin.” We recognize that we still mature and ultimately God will perfect us, and in the meantime we are considered holy, not because we fully and completely merit the designation, but God through his Son has made is possible for us to be holy. And the proof of this is that those who are Christ’s struggle with sin.

Application: Putting us into one family is also what we know as the church. There is one church and we as a local congregation are an expression of it. It is therefore possible for us to call one another brother and sister because we share in this one family with our older brother Jesus.

Transition: Not only do we share in one family, we also share in a common calling

### We share in a common calling

Argumentation: We do have a question that must be answered about this calling. We share in a heavenly calling. So what does this refer to?
This could be a reference to the fact that there is a calling which comes from heaven. This is well in line with Hebrews 1 where God spoke in many time and in many ways, but he now speaks through Christ. That is to say that there is a word which comes from heaven, Jesus.

This could also mean that this is a calling which beckons us to heaven. This too is in line with Hebrews 2 which we also saw that God through Christ brought many sons to glory.

In light of this context, I would argue that it is both. We all have two great needs. We need a word from heaven and a way to heaven. We need God to tell us about ourselves and about a way to him, and we need for him to make a way possible.

This is verified because of The author’s description of Jesus in the very next words. Words that we will turn to shortly.

Application: So now that we see this calling is a word from God and and way to God, how did this calling come about. I think the reason why we can be called holy brothers is grounded in the reality that we have confessed certain things to be true about Christ.

Transition: Not only do we need to know about this position and relationship we have to Christ, but there are specific truths about Christ that we must consider if we are to live the Christian life. The truth in particular that the author of Hebrews wants us to focus on is the faithfulness of Christ.

## We must consider Jesus because of who he is

Transition: Once we know about ourselves and see our needs which have already been met in Christ, we also need to consider some things about how Jesus fill those needs. The author actually directs us to particular aspects of Christ that we must consider, primarily his faithfulness.

### Jesus fills our needs

Just as we have two great needs, Jesus has to qualifications to meet those needs.

#### He is God's Apostle

Explanation: The term apostle is used only here in Hebrews about Jesus. We don’t often use the word to describe him, but it is very appropriate.

From Hebrews 1, it is clear that God speaks through Jesus in a final and ultimate way. This is a clear illustration of what it means to be an apostle. The term itself refers to one who is sent as an emissary or representative of another.

John uses the verb form of Apostle to refer to Jesus’ being sent from God.

Illustration: Jesus’ apostles are those are certainly those who he sent forth.

#### He is Our High Priest

Explanation: The high priest would be a very familiar concept to this audience. In fact the entire letter is called the letter to the Hebrews who had a deep tradition and word from God about the temple, sacrifice, and the duties of the High Priest.

Argumentation: In what way is Jesus a high priest? Though the end of chapter 2 introduces Jesus as high priest, It is not until chapter 5 and 7 that the author tells us exactly what this High priest, Jesus, does.

1. He is assigned as High Priest.
2. He offered prayers
3. He secured salvation
4. He initiates a better covenant
5. He offers gifts and sacrifices to God
6. He does his ministry in a better temple

What do all of these tasks do? Well just like the high priest of the tabernacle and later temple of the old testament, Jesus offers the sacrifice of himself to God which accomplishes two things: (1) atones for our sins, that is to satisfy the legal demands that we have argued against God and (2) and satisfy God’s wrath which was against us for our treason against him.

Application: Chapter three introduced us to to some truths about ourselves, that we are holy brothers and sisters who have a heavenly calling. How then did this happen? The final part of this verse tells us: Jesus is the apostle and high priest of our confession. You were introduced to the family of God because of the work of Christ when you believed and agreed with God about what he has communicated to you in his word.

Transition: Not only is Jesus the apostle and high priest of our common faith, but he is also faithful. 

## Jesus is faithful to God

Explanation: If you were to listen to the original hearers of this letter in the first century, you would hear these words in a little different order. You would pick up on the fact that we are to “consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus, being faithful…”. It is not enough to consider Jesus.

Argumentation: We can perhaps be guilty of this. We talk to someone who does not know Christ whose life is from human appearances falling apart and we urge them: “Have you considered Jesus?” And though we don’t mean it this way, it can come across as something like what we do for shoes: none of those pairs of shoes worked, have you considered this option? as though he were an option among many. However, the author as we have seen, is speaking to those who share in a heavenly calling and are brothers.

The main point the author wants us to see is that Jesus is faithful. He compares Jesus to Moses especially in their faithfulness and that takes up the majority of our text today. In what way is Jesus faithful and how does Moses, who is certainly familiar to the audience, fit into the story.

Transition: We saw that Jesus executes his office as apostle and high priest, but now we also see how Jesus executes his position as son when we consider the relationship between Jesus and Moses and the house that God built.

## We must consider Jesus because he builds the house

3:2-5.

Transition: Not only is Jesus faithful to God in his house, but he is much more than a servant in God’s house. The author now draws our attention to the relationship between Jesus and Moses to illustrate exactly why Jesus’ faithfulness matters.

### Jesus is faithful as Moses was faithful in the house

Illustration: We now turn to the house, which is the key concept in this passage. It’s tempting to think “building” in this passage. We know there are other places that the metaphor of a building is certainly appropriate, such as when Paul compares the members of the church being a building. But here, don’t think “building” think taxes, which are coming up soon. Think “head of household”, since that is metaphor the author will use.

Explanation: The author compares Jesus and Moses’ relationship to the house, the people of God.

Both are called faithful. Remember that the audience that the author is writing to are of the Hebrew people, Jews who have been convinced that Jesus is the messiah, the one who fulfilled everything that the Old Testament talked about and prophesied about. They are being tempted in light of persecution from their own brothers and sisters to return to the temporary things of the temple and sacrifice and by doing so, abandon Christ.

The author has nothing negative to say about Moses and by extension everything he represents including the law. Moses is not presented as one of the bad guys.

God himself commends Moses about his faithfulness and the author uses Numbers 12:7 to prove his point.

Argumentation: why does the author compare Jesus to Moses? The audience the author is writing to gives us some clues. As indicated by the tile, Hebrews, this letter is written to those of Jewish decent. He quotes extensive passages from the OT and talks at length about the temple, sacrifice, and Israel itself. Moses received God's word for the people and thus when one speaks of Moses, they speak of God's revelation and his favor of the people. The audience is very familiar with Moses, but readers have found fulfillment of what Moses was getting at in Jesus. They have believed him as messiah.

However, as persecution of their new faith has intensified, they are in danger of turning back from Jesus back to finding fulfillment in Moses. The author wants us to know that we cannot turn back because Jesus is actually better.

Application: The point of comparison is how both Moses and Jesus are faithful in the household of God. It is vitally important that Jesus was faithful because our entire destiny is dependent upon his faithfulness.

Transition: While both men were faithful, there are also some significant contrasts between Jesus and Moses for which Jesus is worthy of more honor.

### Jesus is worthy of greater honor and glory.

Illustration: Glory: We just got finished with super bowl weekend this week. We as a culture knows what it means to have glory and we know what it means to have greater glory. The teams played and second place is more glorious than first and first is more glorious than gold.

#### The builder of the house is worthy of more glory than the house.

The one who puts the house together and selects the servants, provides for the servants, and commands the servants is the builder and in this case the son who is the heir of all things.

Argumentation: Verse 4 is sometimes taken as a parenthetical statement. But what this verse says is important to the entire discussion and fits in well with everything the author has done so far.

The maker of all things is God
1. Jesus is compared to the builder of a house.
2. Every house is built by someone (Jesus).
3. God builds all things.
Conclusion: Jesus is God

Illustration: The author has mentioned that Jesus is worthy of greater glory just as the builder is worthy of more glory than the house. John Piper uses this illustration and though simple is a very helpful one. Immagine the olympian athletes talking among themselves about who is the greatest sportsman. (1) I can run the 100m faster than anybody else can. (2) I can throw the discus further than anyone else can. (3) I can jump higher than anyone else can. As so the conversations go. Jesus is also there and the attention turns to him and they ask, “So, what are you the best at?” Jesus replies, “I made all this.”

Jesus is in a category entirely to himself. No one can compare. The is an immense difference between being able to do something better than anyone else and being the creator of all things. This aspect of Jesus alone demands our full consideration of him.

Application: Because he created you and I, he is worthy of our full consideration of him.

Transition: Not only is the builder of a home worthy of greater glory, but Jesus is the son of the home.

#### Moses was a servant / Jesus is the son

We now see what the difference between the two is: Moses is a servant in the house (v5), Jesus is a son (v6).

Argumentation: What is the different? A son or heir of the home chooses servants for the home, provides out of his wealth for the home, and he commands the home. A servant does none of these things.

Illustration: What does the servant do, or in this Moses do for the home? This is what Moses says about himself:

The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen (Deut 18:15)

What Moses did is tell us that a greater prophet would come and that Israel must listen to him. He told them about Jesus before Jesus came. Jesus is the greater prophet and therefore greater than Moses.

Transition: We have seen that Jesus is worthy of more glory than Moses because he is the builder of the house and Moses is a servant of the house. Even more amazing is the author's next assertion: We are his house.

## We must consider Jesus because we are his house

Transition: We have seen that we have a common calling and Jesus provides access to God through his ministry and faithfulness as high priest. Now again, we come to a truth about ourselves: we are God’s house.

### We have an affirmation of our stance before God

Before we look at the condition at the end of the verse, notice the statement the author makes about us: We are God's house. From the beginning of this passage, with the heavenly calling that we share in as brothers and sisters, we see that we have a particular relationship with God.

This is a present state of affairs: we are his house. This is affirmed as we saw at the beginning in verse one where we are called holy brothers.

### We have a reason of proof of our stance before God

Though we are the house is a true statement, there is a conditional statement attached with this and a warning in verse 7 through the end of the chapter. The conditional statement is not telling us how we become or keep being God's house. That is already discussed above when we look to Jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession. Rather, the conditional statement is the proof of our belonging to the house.

### We have a warning to consider our stance before God.

## Application:

1. Our passage this morning demands that we obey one simple command: Consider Jesus.
2. Do we help others to consider Jesus, not just in our evangelism, which is certainly appropriate, but what about among ourselves? Do you, men, invest you lives into the younger generation? Women, do you invest in the young ladies. Do you encourage your peers to think about Christ?
3. Have you neglected Christ and have been turning back on him. This was a real possibility for those about 2000 years ago and it is a possibility for us today.
4. We have heard today of Christ's faithfulness, we are also called to be faithful and I think in particular to this passage to be faithful in considering Jesus.

### Consider Israel

The author has made a case that the proper response to God’s final revelation is that those who here are to consider his Son. This harkens back to the context of the Psalms quoted in chapter one, where the psalmist makes clear that the people are to kiss the son lest he be angry.

Now in the rest of chapter three, he points to a generation of people who did not consider God or the word which came through angels, the law. What does it look like to not consider the revealed word of God?

### The Spirit’s Speech

Hebrews 3:7-11 cf. Ps 95:7-11

The Trinity is fully represented in the letter to the Hebrews and this is the first of three times that the Spirit is speaking. The author wants the reader to understand that the quotation from the psalms is not just repeating the words of the Psalmist, but it is the speech of God himself. The context of the Psalm indicates that today is an appropriate time to listen to God and not act like their ancestors. The present tense of the Spirits speech echos that this warning is appropriate for today as well.

The events described in this passage happened in Numbers 14 “where the people grumbled against God at Rephidim because of the lack of water. Moses struck the rock and water gushed forth. He named the place “Massah” (“testing) and “Meribah” (“embitterment”).”

### Israel’s Example

“If you hear his voice…” There is uncertainty about the voice of God: will he speak again or will the people hear.
Prohibition against hardening one's heart. The heart is not just the emotions but also the will. To harden one's heart is to set one’s will against God in rebellion.

The “rebellion” is a euphemism for location of Meribah where there was a lack of water for the nation of Israel.

In Hebrews, it is Israel that provokes the Lord for forty years, while in the Psalm, it was God that was angry with them for forty years.

God’s judgment against them is that that generation would not enter into his rest, that is to say the promised land.

The nation of Israel is a prime example of what happens when one neglects God’s word. However, the example is not just for academic knowledge, but provides a warning and motivation for not neglecting a great salvation.

### Encouragement to Obey by Believing

The primary problem with Israel was that they did not believe and thus did not obey. The remedy for this unbelief today is for us to encourage one another every day.

Not doing this runs the danger of hardening our hearts against God and his word.

With all of this warnings, is there encouragement? Yes. 

Verse 14: Perfect tense “We have come to share…” Because of a state in the past, there is a present state, “we are sharers.” The attached condition is not a condition to enter the state, that condition is in the past. It is a conditional which identifies evidence of the state.
