# Chapter 5

After the author has made the point that Jesus is the hearer’s high priest who can sympathize with human weakness, he turns his attention to the question of how Jesus came to be a high priest.

Introduction. Undergirding this section is the understanding that the author makes explicit: the high priest is chosen to by God to act on behalf of men. That is, the guilty party does not get to choose who represents them to the offended. So the question is, “how did Jesus become our high priest.

## Construction of the text. 

The section from 5:1 to 7:28 form an inclusio with the work and appointment of priests being the refrain repeated in both sections. Chapter 5 begins a discussion about Jesus’ authority and right to be a high priest. The section concludes with the understanding that the Melchizedek priesthood is greater than the Levitical priesthood. Since Jesus comes in the line of Melchizedek, his priesthood is greater than Levi’s.

Chapter 5 has two distinct sections. The first from v1 to v10 considers the comparison between the Aaronic priesthood and Jesus. A chiastic structure focuses the reader’s attention to the major point of contrast between Jesus and Israel’s high priest: there is a difference in lineage.

The second section is the author’s rebuke for their lack of spiritual growth which stems from their lack of understanding and practical application of the word.

## Comparison of Jesus to the High Priest

The section from 5:1 - 10 composes a chiasm which focuses attention on a crucial difference between Jesus and the High priest. The author needs to show that Jesus functions as a high priest in every way, but also to show his legitimacy of his priesthood since the Old Testament prescribed a specific lineage through which the high priest was to come. There are two requirements that any high priest must fulfill. First he must be a sympathetic high priest and second he must be divinely appointed to this task. The author attempts to show that Jesus fits these qualifications by comparing how he and the high priests are similar and different.

## The Office of High Priest

The author first points out in his arguments that the old testament high priest comes from among men. Jesus’ ability to act on behalf of men is intrinsically tied to his humanity. 

## Apostasy

The final paragraph of chapter 5 interjects into the discussion at this point to discuss the possibility of apostasy for the readers of his letter. 

5:11 - 14 The author confronts the readers about their lack of spiritual growth. He wants to talk to them about how Jesus’ priesthood after the order of Melchizedek is better than the levitical priesthood, but he is not sure the readers are ready for what he is about to say.

1. The content the author wants to talk about is “hard to explain.” If this is so, then why does the author chastise the readers? The reason that it is hard to explain is because the reader no longer try to understand. The readers were in a better spiritual position, but have become lax (or unskillful) in hearing the word. The connection between what is heard and obedience is also seen later in verse 14. It is not the content that the author wants to talk about that is hard; it is the hearer that is the problem.

2. Why does the author chastise them? Perhaps he needs to be more patient with them? However, these believers had sufficient time and the author recognized that not only should they understand the things he is about to say, but they should be able to teach other about them already. In the first century, it was commonly understood that the “mature people should be able to teach the less mature.” The point being the the mature believer must have the capacity to teach regardless of their role or office.

3. These believers are not spiritually prepared for handling the sustenance of solid food. The idea of “basic principles” are the initial building blocks for any endeavor of study particularly of language where letters of the alphabet are the basic understanding.

4. The basic principles are the first part of the Christian life. To neglect the more difficult things is to demonstrate a lack of skill with God’s word. In verse 14, the mature are those who practice constantly to distinguish good from evil.

These believers have known Christ for long enough that the should be able to teach about these deep (but not difficult in themselves) truths, but because of their neglect they are deficient. How do we evaluate ourselves in this regard? Are we seeking to understand greater who God is and what he is doing? The idea of eating meat is not so much knowing every tiny little aspect of theology, rather it is taking what we do know and by constant practice allow it to change us from the inside.

We also must recognize that there comes a point where we should be able to “eat meat” and if we are not able to something is wrong with us and needs to be confronted. We will see what the author does with the believer’s immaturity in chapter 6.
