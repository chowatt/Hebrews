# Chapter 4

A major theme in Hebrews is that of REST. In chapter three, the author cites the words of the Spirit concerning Israel's right to enter the land. Because of their disobedience in unbelief, they were refused from the land for forty years until the generation that did not believe passed away. 

There is a rest that was promised to Israel, but they did not obtain it. In one sense, there was a promise of rest in that Israel was to be in the land with their enemies defeated. But ultimately, the rest God has in mind is fellowship with himself, ultimately heaven itself

So, how does the author of Hebrews help us today to see our own need of and provision for REST and what is our duty/response to the promise of rest that God gives?

One way to make a sermon out of this passage is to focus on the four subjunctives in the chapter: “Let us …” Some may even name this passage “four heads of LET US.”

## Fear is the proper response to the promises of God

The promise to Israel of entering the land was denied to one generation because of their unbelief, but there is still a promise of rest. This is seen in the quotation made of Psalm 95, “Today, if you hear his voice.” There is a promise of rest made today to the readers of Hebrews, and by extension to us through Christ.

Because there is a promise of rest, we must fear. Why should we fear? Because there is promised rest that may still be obtained. The nature of this fear is that the group of people to whom the promises were made did not get to enter the promised rest. Why was this the case? They could not enter the rest because they did not believe the promise. So, while we have a promise of Today to hear his voice, we may fail to obtain the promise ourselves because we do not believe.

There is a textual issue to be aware of, but does not change the basic meaning or what the author is trying to get at in verse 2. The word ‘united’ (ESV’) or ‘combined’ (NIV) or ‘mixed’ (KJV) is may have been either plural or singular. If singular (NIV) then it refers to the word which was not mixed with faith while the plural would refer to the people who did not add faith to the word. I take the latter because in the context of Israel’s example, the author wants to encourage his readers that they must believe.

The author uses the hortatory subjunctive to encourage his readers and avoid the judgement of the warnings in chapter 3.

Verse three begins with an indicative statement, those who believe enter his rest. He then supports that this is the case not only for David and his readers, but for the audience today. Finally, the author appends a clause to the end of v3 which shows that the rest was available to that previous generation and the failure to enter the rest was not a result of God not providing rest.

The meaning of rest: This rest that the author speaks has some definition to it. In this verse (v10) it ts the cessation from work. The illustration from Israel shows a point, but it is a little complex. By stopping short of obeying, Israel failed to enter God’s rest. Rest is not the cessation of effort, a point brought in by the author in verse 11, but an obedience to the command of God which brings rest. The obedience God has always demanded is faith. From that flows our effort.

## Striving to enter God’s rest is the proper response to the promises of God

One might conclude that the people entering the land of Canaan was the rest that God promised. In fact, the second generation of Israelites from Sinai actually entered the land, possessed it, and had success in conquering the people of the land. However, that is not the ultimate rest that God promised. There is a rest that God wanted the to join in and was begun at the beginning of the world. Since there is a rest to enter into, and that rest is not assumed: there must there is an obedience of faith that the listener must exercise. That is to say that  we must strive to enter that rest. We cannot ignore God and expect that things will turn out well for us. What is interesting is that the author is not calling us to exercise obedience to a series of works or rituals or any other form of sacrifice, but an obedience to faith. The disobedience spoken of here stands in parallel with disbelief. To disbelieve is to disobey. Believing will bring about obedience.

God has promised his people the same rest that he himself enjoys as evidenced by the authors citation of Genesis 1. The rest that God was speaking of was not the land 

Just as the people of Israel failed to enter God’s rest, there is a sufficient parallel between their situation and ours. That is to say that we, just like them, may fail to enter God’s ultimate rest through our unbelief. The disobedience that Israel had was an act of unbelief which culminated in their actions.

## Topic of discussion: The relationship between faith and works.

### The nature and work of the word of God

In the midst of these exhortations, the author wants to remind us that there since faith is something that cannot be proved by external factors, there is an ultimate judge that will review and cast judgement based upon truth. This act of judging comes from his word.

First the Word of God. The author has already spent much time in chapter 1 and 2 discussing God’s revelation and ultimately speaking through a Son. In this context, The people of Israel had the Word of God given to them on Sinai, but they did not keep the covenant they entered into with God. In contrast to the words of men which sometimes fail to carry through with stated intentions, God’s word is active “in the sense that it speeds to fulfill the purpose for which it was uttered” and carries out what it was sent to do. It also carries the idea that the word is never outdated, but immensely contemporary and we must not dare ignore it but instead recon with it. Isaiah 55 summarizes this statements:

> so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,and shall succeed in the thing for which I sent it. (Isaiah 55:11)
	
Second, The word functions in a particular way in this passage: It diagnoses the inner workings of the human heart. There is debate as to what in particular the illustration of the double edged sword is a reference to. The obvious ones are either military (a sword to kill) or butcher (a sword to cleave). Certainly a sword bearing judgment is in this context. But a third option I think fits the context. The sword or more specifically knife perhaps used by surgeons would be a tool which could open up a person for deep inspection. It is a living and active word which in scripture’s speech, it is able to investigate the depths of the human heart. 

Third, The word penetrates to our core exposing us not just to one another, but to the one to whom we must give an account. Because of this standard which can examine us in such detail, there is no hiding place. Unbelief can be something we can hide from our closest friends and family, but we cannot hide it from God. On top of that, the idea of being exposed is clearly seen in the sacrificial system where a lamb or bull would be exposed to the knife and completely at the mercy of the priest.

## Application of the Word of God.

Though I don’t think that this audience in particular needs much encouragement from this, we still all must give attention to the word of God and cultivate a respect for God’s word even as we study it. We can become masters over God’s word instead of letting his word master us. I believe the nature of the gospel helps us to maintain our proper relationship with the word.

### Holding fast to our confession the proper response to the promises of God

In light of the fact that we have a high priest, Jesus, who became like his brothers and now sits in heaven with his father, we must hold fast to what we have confessed we have believed.

Verse 14 and 15 show that while Jesus is able to be a sympathetic high priest and that he is not not disqualified to be our high priest because of his divine nature. In other words, Does Jesus’ divine nature take away from his ability to help those who are not divine.

Passed through the heavens. How many heavens did he pass through? There had been the idea of different layers of heaves prior to the first century. Paul talks about a vision of the third heaven in 2 Cor 12:2. The pseudepigraphal Assumption of Isaiah speaks of a seventh heaven. However, the author of hebrews does not specify which heavens, but only in a general sense. The meaning that is in view is that the high priest, Jesus, has been exalted to where God sits. This exaltation is what distinguishes Jesus from the Levitical priesthood which would be discussed later in the epistle.

The language of passing through is also used of temple service. The Levitical high priest passed through the veil into the most holy place once a year to offer sacrifice for sins. Jesus, passed through the heavens and later in hebrews we will find that he enters a temple made without hands to offer himself as a sacrifice.

Jesus’ transcendence does not negate his human standing. The Son of God, divine though he is, is also fully human and as such is able to be a sympathetic high priest. Jesus was exposed to every kind of testing that human beings are regularly subjected to, but unlike them, he prevailed.

Peccability vs Impeccability: Naturally the question arises about the nature of Jesus’ humanity and temptation: If Jesus could not sin because he was God, then can he really be tempted? Though this passage does not solve the question, it does add to our understanding. In short, this passage affirms both that Jesus’s temptations were real, and that he succeeded in overcoming them.

Illustration. The best illustration that I know of that helps me to understand the issue and even the context of this passage is that of a swimmer who challenges the open waters of the English channel. The swimmer wants to beat the record for swimming across the channel. In order to get this record, he alone must be the driving force behind swiming across, even through there may be a boat which would travel along side. It is a sure thing that the swimmer would not drown because of the boat ready to pull a rescue, but the record is only available if that rescue never occurs.

In the same way, Jesus, though he was God and it is a sure thing that he could not sin because of his deity, could not be the sympathetic high priest we need if the only reason he did not sin is because he was God. His humanity is what allows him to share in our sufferings and temptations and in his humanity he overcame the same way we might overcome: by dependence on his Father.

If Jesus’s position before God is not enough reason for us to hold fast our confession, the author also gives us an additional reading. If the problem we all face is sin and the consequent judgement of God upon us for our treason, then we need somebody to stand in our place before God. In addition, this high priest also suffered temptations life we do, yet he does not have the burden of sin we have.

Are Jesus’s temptations real? Does jesus’ divinity hinder his ability to help humanity? No! 

## Coming before God is the proper response to the promises of God

The final exhortation from the author in this passage is that since we have a high priest that we come boldly before God’s throne to ask for help in time of our need. The present tense of the verb indicates a continual and regular coming to God. Under the Old Covenant, the people had forgiveness of sins on the day of atonement. However, only the priest could come before God and have close fellowship with him. The worshipper was still prevented from entering the temple.

Things are different now that Christ is our high priest. We have not only forgiveness of sins, but also access to come confidently into God’s presence regularly. 

The throne spoken of here calls to remembrance the mercy seat which is the earthly copy of the throne of God where Christ now sits (1:3.) Since it is a throne, we should recognize the imagery. Wherever one approaches the king's seat of power, we do not do so arrogantly. However, the throne as a sign of the king’s power means that we have someone to turn to who can help us. We are called to approach the throne and this is made possible by the one who passed through the heavens for us. Only the high priest could approach the mercy seat and even that only once a year. But with Christ being the greatest high priest, we may approach boldly to request help. Obviously, we cannot approach arrogantly demanding that God do something for us on the basis of our own merit, but because of what Christ has done we are able.
