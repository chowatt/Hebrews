# Introduction to Hebrews

How would we go about discovering the message of a book of the Bible such as the letter to the Hebrews? We go about 
this by determining the general content and direction of the letter and summarizing it into a statement which attempts 
to take into account the entire letter. For example, two themes (among others of course) stand preeminent in the letter.
The first concerns the person and work of the second person of the Trinity, Jesus. Chapters 1-10:18 show that Christ is 
better than the angels, Moses, and the levitical priesthood culminating in a discussion about his work as priest in a 
better temple. The section of Hebrews proclaims Christ as uniquely qualified to stand as a high priest on behalf of 
human beings. The second half of chapter 10 through the end encourage and persuade the reader that since Christ is 
the faithful high priest, we must shrink back from him or turn back from him, but rather hold on to him because he 
alone makes it possible for us to stand before God as children.

# Main Message of Hebrews

In light of what Hebrews seems to bring out as its themes, I suggest the following working thesis of the letter to the Hebrews:

Because Jesus is the final and great high priest who justifies human beings making them his brothers, those who have been 
redeemed by his work must not turn back or drift from what they have believed.
