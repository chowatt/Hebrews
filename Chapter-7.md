# Chapter 7

**Christ's work as Priest in the order of Melchizedek**

The author of Hebrews introduced the topic concerning Jesus and his relationship to the Melchizedekian priesthood in Chapter 5 now returns in earnest to that subject in Chapter 7. This section which spans from 7:1 to 10:13 is the major doctinal section of this letter. The previous chapters were designed to confront a laxness the believers were in danger of falling in to and give proper motivation to continue on into maturity especially their faith in Christ.

## Translation

> (1) For this Melchizdek, king of Salem [and] priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. (2) And Abraham gave a tenth part of everything to him. [He is] first [by] translation "King of righteousness." and further he is also king of king of Salem which is "king of peace." (3) Having no father or mother or begining of days nor end of life, but having a similarity to the son of God he remains a preist forever.

> (4) Consider how great this man was to whom Abraham the father gave a tenth of the best part of the spoils. (5) And those sons of Levi, receiving a priesthood, have a command according to the law to collect a tenth from the people, that their brothers, although they [themselves] came out from the loins of Abraham. (6) But this one without a geaneology from them extracted a tenth from Abraham, and he blessed him who had the promises. (7) Without any contradiction, the lesser is blessed by the greater. (8) Indeed, on the one hand men who die receive the tenth, but on the other by one [about whom it is] testified that he lives. (9) Evan as a word to say that Levi who collects the tenth paid the tenth through Abraham. For while he was in the loins of the father when Melchesedek met him.
