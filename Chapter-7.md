# Chapter 7

**Christ's work as Priest in the order of Melchizedek**

The author of Hebrews introduced the topic concerning Jesus and his relationship to the Melchizedekian priesthood in Chapter 5 now returns in earnest to that subject in Chapter 7. This section which spans from 7:1 to 10:13 is the major doctinal section of this letter. The previous chapters were designed to confront a laxness the believers were in danger of falling in to and give proper motivation to continue on into maturity especially their faith in Christ.

## Translation

> (1) For this Melchizdek, king of Salem [and] priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. (2) And Abraham gave a tenth part of everything to him. [He is] first [by] translation "King of righteousness." and further he is also king of king of Salem which is "king of peace." (3) Having no father or mother or begining of days nor end of life, but having a similarity to the son of God he remains a preist forever.

> (4) Consider how great this man was to whom Abraham the father gave a tenth of the best part of the spoils. (5) And those sons of Levi, receiving a priesthood, have a command according to the law to collect a tenth from the people, that their brothers, although they [themselves] came out from the loins of Abraham. (6) But this one without a geaneology from them extracted a tenth from Abraham, and he blessed him who had the promises. (7) Without any contradiction, the lesser is blessed by the greater. (8) Indeed, on the one hand men who die receive the tenth, but on the other by one [about whom it is] testified that he lives. (9) Evan as a word to say that Levi who collects the tenth paid the tenth through Abraham. For while he was in the loins of the father when Melchesedek met him.

## Melchizedek's Priesthood is Better than Levi's Priesthood

Our author wanted to tell his audiance a great deal about Melchizedek in 5:11, but digressed in order to warn and encourage them in their spiritual growth. Now the author returns to the topic of Melchizedek and his relationship with Jesus the Son. Undergirding this section is a question of great importance: How can Jesus be a high priest? There were certain things perscribed by the law concerning Israel's priest hood. First, Aaron and his son's were to serve as priests in Israel (Exodus 28:1). Second, they were assigned a uniform and tasks. Third, they were chosen by concent of their fellow priests (Lev 21:10). It is clear that Jesus did not come from the line of Aaron: he was born a Judite. In order to show how Jesus is a high priest in truth, he must show that his priestly lineage is traced to another kind of priest outside of Aaron. This is why the author focuses so much detail on Melchizedek. The second purpose the author has in this task is to show that Jesus' priesthood is actually superior to that of Levi.

### Who is Melchizedek
**Hebrews 7:1-3**

There are two primary Old Testament texts which deals with Melchizedek: Genesis 14 and Psalm 110:4. The author reflects on these passages and brings them to bear on the current question.

Verses 1-2 recount Genesis 14 in a concise way.

> Melchizedek was a priest-king of the city Salem, who met Abraham as he return from routing certain invading kings. In the Old Testament narrative, four kings from the east [...] marched on a confederiation of find kings from Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela. The armies of the latter were defated in a valley called Siddim and their cities plundered. Lot, Abraham's nephew, was among the captives taken from Sodom, a fact bought to the attention ot the patriarch by a servant who had escaped the battle. Abraham pursued the invaders to Dan, where he staged a night-time attack, puttings the enemies to flight and recovering their booty. After his return home both the king of Sodom and Melchizedek, priest of God Most High, met Abraham. The author of hebrews focuses on Abraham's encounter with the latter, in which Abraham gave a tithe and received a blessing. (Guthrie, 535)

The author then uses the name of Melchesedek's name and posidition to describe his character. These are the very characteristics that describe "one who prefigures the Messiah, who would make righteousness and peace possible for the people of God." (Guthrie, 535) Though the author does not explicitly show why these attributes are important, they are qualities that were sought out and required for Israel's priests. The final aspect that the author draws out of Melchesedek is that the text in which we find him mentions nothing of his geneology. This argument from Silance is defaning! His lack of birth narrative is kind of the point: One thing we know is that Melchesedek is not a decended of Levi, because Levi was not yet born.

### How is Melchesedek Great
**Hebrews 7:4-10**

There is a particular act that shows this Melchesedek to be great: he collected a tithe from Abraham. The Levitical priest has a great privilige and responsiblity. By law they were to collect a tithe from their brothers. The Levites had no land of their own but were to be supported by their brothers through this giving. A full 8 percent of Israel were to be dedicated to serving God on behalf of the nation. The contrast here in this passage is that one who is not a Levite collected tithes from Abraham, the patriarch of Levi. The reason that Melchesedek is greater than Levi is that he collected a tithe from Levi because Abraham payed the tithe.

Melchesedek is declared to be greater than Levi also because he blessed Abraham. The Phrase "And without a doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater" is not to be taken as axiom stating that only superiors bless inferiors. Melchesedek blesses God after he blesses Abraham showing this to be a false understanding. Rather, the contrast is that with all the priviliges that Abraham received, "he recognized the superiority of Melchizedek by accepting a blessing at his hands." (Fee, 161)

The point the author wants to make is that "Jesus' priesthood is great than that of the Levitical priests of the Old Testament." (Guthrie, 554) The fact that the author sees great value in the Old Testament texts shows us that we should not undervalue the OT, but rather seek to see what it meant in it's context and the trajectory later authors, such as the author of Hebrews, clarify. We are not at liberty to set aside the OT as outdated nor to interpret the OT at our own whims. God directed history, especially Israel's history, to bring about salvation in Christ and our sanctification.

## Jesus' Priesthood is One Like Melchesedek's
**Hebrews 7:11-14**

The question that undergirds much of this letter is now raised in this paragraph. If the Levitical priesthood was able to accomplish everything that was needed for the people of God, why does God need to bring in another high priest from a liniage other than Levi? "The Aaronic priesthood was neither designed nor competent to inaugurate the age of fulfilment; that age must be marked by the rise of antoher priest, whos priesthood was of a different order and character from Aaron's" (Fee, 163.) The people of God, Israel, had the law which mandated and provided for the priesthood through Levi. Why this priesthood is not not sufficient will be answered in chapter 10, but for now the author demonstrates that because there is another priesthood that God declared, there was at least some problem with the first, even if we may not know what it is.

To go along with a new priesthood, a new law is also established. Since the Mosaic law percribed that the priesthood needed to come through Levi, if another priesthood were to be established, there would have to be another law which mandates it. The terms we will see in this passage such as **Law**, **covenant**, and **commandment** seem to be related. Covenant and Testament (as in "last will and testament") are also related and the author will speak to this later. There are two reasons why this new law needed to be established. First, as we saw, a new priesthood not from Levi needed to happen. Second, Jesus is not from Levi, but from Judah. The law does not say anything about a priest from Judah and the Old Testament also makes it clear that when non-Levites offer sacrifices, God was not happy. Uzziah, a Judite, burned incense before the Lord and was struck with Leprosy (2 Chron 26-16-20). Because of this, Jesus was not able to offer sacrifices as priest according to Mosaic Law. However, another priesthood is possible by another law.

### Jesus' Connection to Melchesedek
**Hebrews 7:15-19**

Jesus, though not a priest from Levi, is errerily similary to Melchesedek. First off, God's oath that was quoted from Psalm 110:4 makes the relationship concrete: the Father declares that the Son is a priest after the order of Melchesedek. Next, the very qualities that the author pointed out from the name of Melchesedek are certainly true of Christ. Finally, the fact that Melchesedek does not have an end of days is also true in a litteral sense for Jesus. Jesus may not be a priest qualified through Mosaic law, but he is certainly a priest through the promise of God and this oath.

Can God's law be changed? That is the question raised by our author in verse 18. Now in this context, the particular law that is set aside is the regulation concerning the lianiage of Levi. This is one of the imperfections of the Levitical priesthood. "You are a preist for ever." "These words are quite inapplicable to the old order; no priest of Aaron's line could have been described as 'a priest for ever,' for the simple reason that each one of them died in due course" (Fee, 167.) The entire Levitical priesthood was an exercise in the transient: a physical temple, physical animal sacrifice, physical decent of priests, etc... 

By God declaring that the Son is a priest forever after the order of Melchesedek, he abrogates the law he gave at Sinai. Does this mean that the law is ineffective? No, it was "intended to foreshadow something better" (Guthrie, 563.) This change in the Law is clear because someone like the Melchizedekian priest has appeared: Jesus stands as this high priest.

The reason that this law needed to be set aside is so that a new hope can come through the one who is to be this Melchesedekian priest. Under the Old Covenant, the High priest drew near to God for the people; now, we can draw near to God because of Christ.

### God Establishes a Permanent Priesthood and New Order Through an Oath
**Hebrews 7:20-25**

The implied question here is "how does God establish this new order? The negative answer is that "it was not without an oath." God's oath is the legally binding and authoritative source for this new order.

As we saw in chapter 6, an oath is a legally binding confimation about the oath takers' commitment and promise about the truthfulness of his statement or intention to fulfill it. In this case, God made an oath to institute this new priesthood. In this oath, there was collateral that was offered, namely Jesus and the Guarantee of the new covanent.

> The word referred to a person who guaranteed the position or endeavors of someone else while putting him-or herself at risk.In the present context the author pictures Jesus as the one who guarantees God's covenant promises. The hearers, as new covanent people, have a covenant that is "better" because, by virtue of God's oath, Jesus, the mediator of that covanentn, holds an unalterable position. Our hope, therefore, rests on the most secure of terms.

The permanence of the new priesthood stands in stark contrast to the Levitical priesthood. First, there were many priest, infact a whole tribe of them. However, second, the reason there there were so many was because the kept dying and could not continue as priest. This new priest died once, but lives forever and he alone is the priest of this new covanent. The reason he is able to act as high priest completely is because he lives forever making intercession for those whom he saves.

### Jesus' priesthood is a permaant priesthood
**Hebrews 7:26-28**

The practical application of this is that we must recognize that we have this high priest. The author has urged the reader to not neglect their salvation and this is the core of that salvation; Jesus interceeds on our behalf before God, whom we have rebelled against, and makes intercession for us. The quality of this priest is in contrast to us: He is holy, while we are unholy. He is innocent, while we are guily. He is exaulted, while we apart from him are under God's wrath. The priests needed to offer sacrifices for themselves before they could offer sacrifice for the people, but Jesus had no need for a sacrifice for himself.

The Mosaic law appointed men who were weak to be high priest, but Jesus was appointed by divine oath. This is why he is the perfect mediator.
