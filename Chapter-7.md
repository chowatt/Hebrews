# Chapter 7

**Christ's work as Priest in the order of Melchizedek**

The author of Hebrews introduced the topic concerning Jesus and his relationship to the Melchizedekian priesthood in Chapter 5 now returns in earnest to that subject in Chapter 7. This section which spans from 7:1 to 10:13 is the major doctinal section of this letter. The previous chapters were designed to confront a laxness the believers were in danger of falling in to and give proper motivation to continue on into maturity especially their faith in Christ.

## Translation

> (1) For this Melchizdek, king of Salem [and] priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him. (2) And Abraham gave a tenth part of everything to him. [He is] first [by] translation "King of righteousness." and further he is also king of king of Salem which is "king of peace." (3) Having no father or mother or begining of days nor end of life, but having a similarity to the son of God he remains a preist forever.

> (4) Consider how great this man was to whom Abraham the father gave a tenth of the best part of the spoils. (5) And those sons of Levi, receiving a priesthood, have a command according to the law to collect a tenth from the people, that their brothers, although they [themselves] came out from the loins of Abraham. (6) But this one without a geaneology from them extracted a tenth from Abraham, and he blessed him who had the promises. (7) Without any contradiction, the lesser is blessed by the greater. (8) Indeed, on the one hand men who die receive the tenth, but on the other by one [about whom it is] testified that he lives. (9) Evan as a word to say that Levi who collects the tenth paid the tenth through Abraham. For while he was in the loins of the father when Melchesedek met him.

## Melchizedek's Priesthood is Better than Levi's Priesthood

Our author wanted to tell his audiance a great deal about Melchizedek in 5:11, but digressed in order to warn and encourage them in their spiritual growth. Now the author returns to the topic of Melchizedek and his relationship with Jesus the Son. Undergirding this section is a question of great importance: How can Jesus be a high priest? There were certain things perscribed by the law concerning Israel's priest hood. First, Aaron and his son's were to serve as priests in Israel (Exodus 28:1). Second, they were assigned a uniform and tasks. Third, they were chosen by concent of their fellow priests (Lev 21:10). It is clear that Jesus did not come from the line of Aaron: he was born a Judite. In order to show how Jesus is a high priest in truth, he must show that his priestly lineage is traced to another kind of priest outside of Aaron. This is why the author focuses so much detail on Melchizedek. The second purpose the author has in this task is to show that Jesus' priesthood is actually superior to that of Levi.

### Who is Melchizedek
**Hebrews 7:1-3**

There are two primary Old Testament texts which deals with Melchizedek: Genesis 14 and Psalm 110:4. The author reflects on these passages and brings them to bear on the current question.

Verses 1-2 recount Genesis 14 in a concise way.

> Melchizedek was a priest-king of the city Salem, who met Abraham as he return from routing certain invading kings. In the Old Testament narrative, four kings from the east [...] marched on a confederiation of find kings from Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela. The armies of the latter were defated in a valley called Siddim and their cities plundered. Lot, Abraham's nephew, was among the captives taken from Sodom, a fact bought to the attention ot the patriarch by a servant who had escaped the battle. Abraham pursued the invaders to Dan, where he staged a night-time attack, puttings the enemies to flight and recovering their booty. After his return home both the king of Sodom and Melchizedek, priest of God Most High, met Abraham. The author of hebrews focuses on Abraham's encounter with the latter, in which Abraham gave a tithe and received a blessing. (Guthrie, 535)

The author then uses the name of Melchesedek's name and posidition to describe his character. These are the very characteristics that describe "one who prefigures the Messiah, who would make righteousness and peace possible for the people of God." (Guthrie, 535) Though the author does not explicitly show why these attributes are important, they are qualities that were sought out and required for Israel's priests. The final aspect that the author draws out of Melchesedek is that the text in which we find him mentions nothing of his geneology. This argument from Silance is defaning! His lack of birth narrative is kind of the point: One thing we know is that Melchesedek is not a decended of Levi, because Levi was not yet born.

### How is Melchesedek Great
**Hebrews 7:4-10**

There is a particular act that shows this Melchesedek to be great: he collected a tithe from Abraham. The Levitical priest has a great privilige and responsiblity. By law they were to collect a tithe from their brothers. The Levites had no land of their own but were to be supported by their brothers through this giving. A full 8 percent of Israel were to be dedicated to serving God on behalf of the nation. The contrast here in this passage is that one who is not a Levite collected tithes from Abraham, the patriarch of Levi. The reason that Melchesedek is greater than Levi is that he collected a tithe from Levi because Abraham payed the tithe.

Melchesedek is declared to be greater than Levi also because he blessed Abraham. The Phrase "And without a doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater" is not to be taken as axiom stating that only superiors bless inferiors. Melchesedek blesses God after he blesses Abraham showing this to be a false understanding. Rather, the contrast is that with all the priviliges that Abraham received, "he recognized the superiority of Melchizedek by accepting a blessing at his hands." (Fee, 161)

The point the author wants to make is that "Jesus' priesthood is great than that of the Levitical priests of the Old Testament." (Guthrie, 554) The fact that the author sees great value in the Old Testament texts shows us that we should not undervalue the OT, but rather seek to see what it meant in it's context and the trajectory later authors, such as the author of Hebrews, clarify. We are not at liberty to set aside the OT as outdated nor to interpret the OT at our own whims. God directed history, especially Israel's history, to bring about salvation in Christ and our sanctification.

## Jesus' Priesthood is One Like Melchesedek's
