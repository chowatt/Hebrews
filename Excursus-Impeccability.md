# Excursus: Impeccability vs Peccability

The question raised here is the question, “was Christ able to sin” or, negatively, “was Christ not able to sin.” Let us look at four issues related to this question: 1) where the question itself comes from, 2) why the question is important, 3) how Scripture gives us the information to answer this question, 4) a proposal to put the evidence together to form an answer.

## Where does the question come from?

Why is this question raised in the first place? Because the author of Hebrews wants to show his audience at this point that the human priests of the tribe of the levites were able to minister to the people they served because they themselves were weak and faced temptation just as the worshippers did. Now, a greater high priest comes on the scene, one who is the Son of God. As such there is no question as to his relationship with sin: he has never committed any! But the question remains is this priest sympathetic to the fallen human condition? The issue is not that Jesus needed sin in order to be sympathetic to our condition, but rather did he feel the weight of temptation that we did and overcome it.

## Why does this issue matter?

The issue matters because of another aspect of our understanding of Jesus: the relationship between his divine and human natures.

## What must we affirm with Scripture?

Scripture does give us some direct and clear information related to Christ and his relationship with temptation.

Christ never actually sinned. This fact is attested to in several places in Scripture. First our passage declares that although he faced temptation, he did not sin. Paul affirms that Jesus had no experience of sin: 

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (2 Cor. 5:21)

> Later, the author of Hebrews will again defend the sinlessness of Christ: “For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.” (Hebrews 7:26)

> Peter declares Jesus to be “a lamb without blemish or spot.” (1 Peter 1:19) and that “He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.” (1 Peter 2:22).

It is clear that Scripture affirms that Jesus never actually committed sin, but in every way obeyed the Father perfectly.

Christ’s temptations were real temptations. The wilderness temptations (Matt 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13) reveal the nature and essence of temptation in Christ’s life. Jesus’ temptations parallel Adam and Eve’s temptations in the garden. The temptation in both cases was not to violate some moral principle, but to obey a direct command of God. Since the Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness, wwe may imply that it was God’s will that Jesus was to abstain from food for forty days. Grudem understands this situation to be “a test of pure obedience to God’s specific directive.” The force of the temptation can be felt when one considers that Jesus had the power to turn stones to bread. We are never tempted to do things we think we are incapable of doing. Another aspect to his temptations were that the temptations were a test of his obedience as a man. He had to obey in his human strength. To use his divine powers to cheat and make the stones bread would be to disobey the direct command of his father.

God cannot be tempted with evil. James affirms that God cannot be tempted with evil: it is his very nature which is good and opposed to evil. He himself defines goodness. This is the point of Scripture which makes the question difficult: if Jesus is God, and God cannot be tempted, then is it not true that Jesus cannot be tempted?

## How shall we deal with this question?

Whenever we talk about the second person of the Trinity, we must always bear in mind that Jesus has two natures: human and divine. The two nature do not mix or as some statements make reference that the natures remain distinct without mixing together. What is true of one nature cannot necessarily be said of the other nature. We must also remember that Jesus is one person with two natures. Grudem believes that it was ultimately not possible for Jesus to sin since “the union of his human and divine natures in one person prevented it.” However, I would want to clarify that in Jesus’ human nature, if one could possibly separate it, he would have had the same nature as Adam and Eve.

The reason that Jesus temptation were real, even though it was assured that he would not sin, is that he suffered temptation by using only the power of his human nature and did not rely on his divine nature to overcome the temptation. 

Grudem uses the illustration of weight lifters who lift a heavy load over their heads. The one who sustains the lift for the required time felt the weight of the load more fully than the one who dropped the weight.

In reference to James 1:13, Grudem writes:

> It seems that this is one of a number of things that we must affirm to be true of Jesus’ divine nature but not of his human nature. His divine nature could not be tempted with evil, but his human nature could be tempted as was clearly tempted. How these two natures united in one person in facing temptation, Scripture does not clearly explain to us. But this distinction between what is true of one nature and what is true of another nature is an example of a number of similar statements that Scripture requires us to make.
