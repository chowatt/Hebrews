# Chapter 2

As we discovered in the previous chapter, God speaks in a final authoritative way by a Son (en huisos). Chapter two warns that if God’s speech through angels previously was authoritative and disobedience of that speech was liable for punishment, how much more judgement would disobedience to the Son’s speech bring? The answer is that there is no escape from punishment if one neglects the salvation found in Christ.
The section of 2:1-4 is the first of the warning passages in Hebrews. The total number of warnings is either 4 or 5 depending on how one deals with chapter 12.

## Why Neglect a Great Salvation?

The author of Hebrews asks the question one way, but we may also ask another question: why would one neglect a great salvation? John Piper notes that one might neglect this salvation if it 1) is not great or 2) if it is not true. It is the second one that seems to be in mind for the rest of the section. The author emphasises that the salvation is true and is shown to be true through two lines of evidence.

### Salvation is evidenced by the word

The first line of evidence is mentioned in the second half of verse 3: The source of this salvation was given by none other that the Lord Jesus himself. This is the “great” of the great salvation. Just as angel proclaimed the word to the fathers by the prophets, Jesus now proclaims the salvation that, as we will learn, he will institute in his office as high priest.

This salvation began (idea behind “at first”) in the life of Christ. The entire life of Christ (birth, life, preaching, miracles, death, resurrection) is part and parcel of the salvation we receive.

Not only was this salvation began in Christ, but those who were his apostles recorded and spoke about this salvation. Therefore, we have a record of what Christ has instituted. We have heard it as well because faithful people have repeated the truth about this salvation.

God also testified as to the veracity to this salvation through the means of signs, wonders, miracles, and gifts. This is a good summary of what one finds in the book of acts.

## The Founder of Salvation

The author resumes his discussion of angels from chapter one, this time focusing on the aspect of authority over creation. This section transitions from a discussion on how the Son is better than angels to his role in the redemption of humanity.

### The relationship of humanity to creation 
(2:6-8 cf. ps 8)

The author quotes a passage from Psalm 8 in order to prove the case that humanity has been given authority over creation, but that something happened and that authority is frustrated.

God cares for undeserving human beings. The psalmist reflects of God's love and care for humanity since they are insignificant compared with God's all consuming significance.

The position of humanity is one of weakness; we are not as powerful as the angels that God has created. We are also limited in our time upon the earth.

God places the future of the world into the hands of humanity echoing Genesis 1:26. 

The author interprets the Psalm by pointing out that nothing is outside of God’s appointed control to humanity. 

### Jesus fulfills in his humanity what humanity could not (2:8b - 9).

Although the world to come is given to humanity, when one looks at the world today, one does not see thing in control. Natural disasters, sickness and disease, famine, crop failure, dominate the world not to mention the great failure of humanity to be kind to one another and the presence of wars and crime against one another. One must look around, observe the world and conclude that the world is not in subjection to humanity.

In contrast to what we observe in the world, what we see in Jesus is that he has been crowned with glory and honor.

The author of Hebrews uses this passage from the psalter and applies it directly to Jesus, who as the second Adam has all authority that has been placed under his control by God himself.

### Jesus has to take on humanity for humanity's salvation

The end of verse 9 has a cause statement: because of the suffering of death. What does this refer to? 1) It could refer to Jesus exaltation with glory and honor because he suffered death. Or 2) it could refer to the reason why he was made lower than the angels. Both are true for sure.

The purpose of his death is so that he might show grace to humanity by experiencing death for everyone.

## The Elder Brother of Those who Believe

How is the older brother made perfect?

The author tells us that it was fitting for Jesus to suffer, and that this suffering makes him perfect. In what way is this the case. 
The section makes the case that Jesus has to be made like his brothers in order to procure salvation. 

The family that Jesus is building all share in something, in particular, suffering. It would not do to have every member of this family be unified in suffering, but one member not. How could the older brother be sympathetic to his brothers if he did not suffer himself?

Brother: you don’t understand. You have not suffered like I have.

Jesus can respond that, “yes, I have suffered”

Because both the save and the savior have suffered, they can be called brothers.

The author cites several passages to bolster his case and his conclusion is stated explicitly in verse 14.

## Jesus leads us into salvation

For Jesus to become our savior, he had to enter into the world in which we live; and he did! His connection affords us the means whereby our sins may be forgiven. The rest of the chapter outlines what Jesus did by his death.

### Jesus shared in humanity to overcome death (v. 14)

Verse 14 in essence says that just as we have “flesh and blood,” that is a physical existence in bodies, the savior also had to partake in those things.

Argumentation: So, if Jesus took on our nature, what does that mean? It means he had a body like you and I. He had emotion. He suffered death. The question then is: did Jesus sin? The question is asked because it seems that sin is an integral part of who we are; we cannot escape it. However, I would suggest, that sin is something that is unnatural to humans as they were originally created. In fact, you could say that Jesus' sinlessness is actually more human than our sin nature – Jesus shows us what humanity was supposed to look like.

#### The accomplishment of his death

Jesus accomplished much in his death. The author declares the enemy death – dead! In this way, Satan has the power of death and Jesus' death brought destruction to Satan. Satan can no longer claim for his own those who are Christ's!

Argumentation: Fear is a powerful motivator, and even more so when it seems that Satan has entered himself in alliance with death! This is what Jesus has accomplished: he set us free from the fear of death. Though we will die, for the christian this is not an insurmountable fear. For the believer, we die and see the one who saved us and enter into his paradise. Death does not have power over us when God has taken us into his family.

### Jesus ministered to humanity (v. 16)

In this short verse, the author simply reminds us again that Jesus death was not for angels, but for humanity. The phrase “children of Abraham” is ambiguous. Surely the book of Hebrews was written to the Israelites, of whom Abraham is their Father. However, if the author wanted to limit this to only those Israelites who believe in the savior, the author could have said “children of Jacob.” The promises made to Abraham have a world wide and universal appeal: all nations through you shall be blessed!

## Recap (v 17,18)

Verses 17 and 18 recap much of what has already been done in chapter 2. The expansion here is that Jesus' humiliation and incarnation made him capable “to be the merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God.” This is actually the topic of much of the rest of Hebrews beginning in chapter 3. Though I have already assumed it in this message so far, the author of Hebrews spells it our for us in in the next phrase: he made propitiation for the sins of the people. 

### Propitiation

Two words are often used to describe the relationship of our sin to God when we believe his son. Those words are expiation and propitiation. They are similar but have a couple nuances. Expiation is where the source of divine wrath is removed and therefore the deity is no longer wrathful. This is close to what the author means, but who of us here believe that sin has not found its way back into our lives even through we are saved? Rather, the word the author of hebrews uses is propitiation. Propitiation is where the wrath of deity is appeased but the cause of the wrath remains.

Argumentation: We have already seen this a couple times in this chapter where an initial aspect takes place and then at a later time a complete aspect will happen. For example, Jesus is the ultimate sovereign of the universe, but we do not see all things under his control yet. Here, sin has been dealt a death blow from which it cannot recover: Jesus paid the penalty for sin, and when we meet him sin itself will be removed from us. He was able to do this because he is the great high priest.

### Jesus' temptations

Just as the sermon began with Jesus being made perfect through suffering, the last verse of our chapter repeats that idea: Jesus has suffered. To clarify, that suffering came as a result of trials and temptations, a point that the author makes clear in 4:15.
