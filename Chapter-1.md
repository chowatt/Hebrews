# Introduction

Chapter one divides into two section. The introduction (1:1-4) identifies the subject of the letter to the Hebrews: God speaks in a final and complete way through his Son. The second section deals with a particular question concerning the relationship of the person, identified as the Son, and angels.

## God Speaks

The author introduces the letter by drawing the reader's attention to adverbs which describe God’s speech through the ages. At Many Times. This describes the fact that God revealed his work over time and not all at once. In Many Ways. The various methods God used to speak to the fathers. There was a diversity of ways in which God spoke to the fathers. This includes the means of communication such as speech, visions, dreams, oracles, prophecies, etc, but also the form in which that communication came such as law, history, psalms and proverbs.

The first activity the author mentions is the speaking of God. This occurred in the time past. The main subject and verb occur in verse 2. There are at least two ways to understand God’s previous speaking and his speaking now. One way to see it is that after God spoke to the father, he now speaks to us. However, the time aspect is probably not the primary focus of the author. Rather, he is probably seeking to show a significant shift in the way that God speaks. Although he spoke to the father … he speaks to us. The emphasis is not so much on the time, but on the means by which he speaks: he speaks to us through His Son. The prophets communicated God’s message through their speech and writings, but God communicates through the son not just by his words, but also by his works.

In contrast to the multiple prophets and multiple ways, God has now spoken by a Son. This son has a particular character which is also described by the author in four ways, " the author moved to describe further the exalted status of the Son in several relative and participial clauses, each identifying the Son in his relationship to the Father, to creation, to the redemption of humanity, and to eschatological sovereignty.”

He has been appointed heir of all things. God intends that everything in the created realm is ultimately inherited by Jesus. 

He also created all things. Jesus was instrumental in the creation of the universe. Because of the relationship of the Trinity, it is true that God created all things, but he did so through the instrument of the Son. Since Jesus was responsible for everything that is created, the Author implies that the Son was preexistent to all creation. The creation is aiōnas (age, universe), not kosmos. Though aiōnas could be used as a synonym, it is more likely that the author not only has the creation in mind, but also the flow of history and its unfolding. 

We also see the Son’s relationship to the father. The description is unmistakable language of deity. Radiance of glory. Could be either active or passive. The work is only used once here, so it is hard to determine. Regardless, its meaning does not change much: Jesus is so closely related to God that he is identified as God. Exact Imprint of his nature. Coins which are minted are pressed between two dies which transfer the image on the die to the coin. In this context, what Jesus looks like is what God looks like.

Not only does Jesus create the universe, but he also sustains it.

Not only does Jesus create and sustain the universe, but also redeems it.
Jesus Revelation Better than Angels

Verse four bridges the gap between the section 1-3 to the rest of the chapter. In the first part, the final revelation of Jesus is better than the revelation by the prophets. Here, Jesus has obtained a better name than the angels. The role of angels in the delivery of God’s revelation is not explicitly stated in the OT, but it is known by the NT writers (Acts 7:38–39; Gal 3:19). The author of Hebrews will return to the idea of revelation which came through angels in chapter two. Because of the proximity of the discussion of revelation through prophets, the author uses this as an opportunity to discuss the other ways in which the son is better than angels.

## The Nature of Revelation
1. God’s revelation of himself
2. Both in acts and in speech
3. In OT, especially the prophets, God’s word came through visions and cryptic messages. Moses spoke with God face to face, but God did not speak with most people this way.
4. Jesus, who is God’s final revelation, spoke to us face to face.
